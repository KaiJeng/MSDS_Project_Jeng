# Data Wrangling Project 2016
Video Game Sales Analysis

This project gathers data from multiple websites to try and analyze the video game market. This includes data that involves
game sales, game genre, game reviews, game release date, among others.

Initially, a UI was built in R Shiny to dynamically search and compare video game sales. This idea was further enhanced
through the use of machine learning to better analyze the impact of possible factors influencing video game sales.
